# FizzBuzzApp
Mini FizzBuzz Web App for Burwood
What was your reasoning behind the tech stack used for this challenge?
I used Python, Flask, little JavaScript, Html & CSS. And I kept it simple with the frontend because I knew this was a very small web applicaton and the focus was on highlighting my skills in Python. But I showed with the basic I did use for the frontend that I can easily making it more presentable and even throw in some frontend frameworks like React to make it more scalable and maintainable.

Backend I use Flask SQLAlchemy ORM and main reason for that is becuase when you know the web app is going to be very small and have small usage ORM is best for speed and ease of use.

What piece of this challenge did you find the most challenging and why?
Honestly working around Flask SQLAlchemy ORM to retrieve the top 3 most common inputs from the User and only because I haven't used this form of SQL in a decent amount of time. So had to pull up documentation for a refresher.

How would you deploy this application for external users to use?
I would use firebase for my own personal project.

After deploying your code, it seems to have gone viral as the most awesome app ever created in the history of time itself. How would you handle scaling and support your FizzBuzz app?

I would redesign some parts of the website to be used for more customers and to make it more scalable in long terms. For example, I would probably change the sql I use to PostgreSQL. Can use it better for more complex queries.

I would as mention earlier add more to the frontend design and most likely use a frontend framework such as React to help with scaling in the long run.
 Would probably change the logic for retrieving the top three most common numbers from the database just so time & space complexity can be better which would matter with more inputs from more users.
 
 I would make sure security key is hidden.
 
 I would also make sure the server can handle more traffic on it as well.
